This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##

Project is still in progress. At the moment is only desktop version. This site at first time was created with the aim of my wedding. Unfortunetly I had to to abandon thisproject (as well as learning of front-end development). From March I'm back to game. Firstly i refreshed knowledge obtained last year.
Currently I return to work on this project changing his destination and contest. At the same time I develop my skills in React.

The next features to implement are:
  - resize pictures
  - lazy loading
  - react-google-map
  - probably giving up node sass and refactoring css with mobile view consideration
  - and much more...
